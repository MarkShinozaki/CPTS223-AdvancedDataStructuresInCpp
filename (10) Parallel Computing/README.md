

## Course Expectations
- Approach and solve problems differently, including typical interview questions.
- Build programming skills to help secure an internship.
- Dedication and hard work are expected.

## What is Computer Science?
- **Definition:** The study of computers and computational systems with a focus on algorithms.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Intersects theory with practice.
  - Requires abstract and concrete thinking.
  - Not just about building computers but also planning, designing, and applying systems.
  - Emphasizes algorithm efficiency and software performance.
- **Areas of Study:** AI, Machine Learning, Networks, Graphics, Security, Big Data, Bioinformatics, Software Engineering, Computer Systems, Database Systems.

## Algorithms in Computer Science
- **Definition:** A sequence of instructions that solve a problem.
- **Importance:** Algorithms automate solutions and can be repeated to solve problems.
- **Properties of Algorithms:**
  - Well-ordered, unambiguous, and effectively computable operations.
  - Produces a result and halts in a finite amount of time.

## Algorithm Structure
- **Instructions:**
  - Sequenced: Follow the order given.
  - Conditional: Execute if a condition is true.
  - Iterative: Continue while a condition holds.

## High-Level Programming Languages
- **Overview:** Languages like BASIC, Pascal, C++, and their relation to machine and natural languages.
- **Key Points:**
  - High-level languages need translation by compilers to run on machines.
  - They often use pre-written code libraries (e.g., for math or I/O functions).
  - Execution involves linking and loading stages to prepare the program for use.

## Program Execution and Development
- **Execution:** Programs run in a console where input is given and output is displayed.
- **IDEs:** Tools like Microsoft Visual Studio simplify the process by integrating compilers, linkers, and editors, providing syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and debugging tools.

## Course Next Steps
- Focus on practical application of software development principles and learning programming languages like C.


2. **Design:** Develop initial and refined algorithms for calculating the cone's volume.
3. **Implementation:** Code the algorithm in C, managing inputs, and displaying the calculated volume.
4. **Testing:** Test with various input values to observe outputs, emphasizing boundary conditions.
5. **Maintenance:** Regular improvements and updates are essential for software longevity.

## Applying the Software Development Method

### Iterative Development
- Encourages evolving solutions and learning through iterative refinement.

### Data Requirements and Design
- Define the problem, data inputs, and outputs followed by a detailed algorithm design.

### Implementation and Testing
- Focus on coding the solution in C and verifying it through testing, not worrying initially about the details of C syntax.
